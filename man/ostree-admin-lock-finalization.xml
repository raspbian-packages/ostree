        <para>
            This command requires a staged deployment.  By default, this command ensures the deployment
            will be set into a "finalization locked" state, which means it will not be queued for the next boot by default.
        </para>
        <para>
            This is the same as the <literal>--lock-finalization</literal> argument for <literal>ostree admin deploy</literal>,
            which is the recommended way to use this feature in a race-free way.
        </para>
        <para>
            However more commonly, one will use the <literal>--unlock</literal> argument for this command to later unlock
            a deployment which was finalization locked.
